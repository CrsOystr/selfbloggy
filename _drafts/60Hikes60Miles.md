A few years ago I began hiking in the mountains around my house, I had been hiking many times growing up but it was only in family situations. I knew nothing about most of the mountains around me and I ended up doing the same short hikes near my house. One day I found a book called [60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Salt La][amazonLink]
