A few years ago I began hiking on the small mountain trails around my house, I had been hiking many times growing up but it was only in family situations. I knew nothing about most of the mountains around me and I ended up doing the same hikes over and over. One day I found a book called [60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Salt La][amazonLink] and decided to start going on few hikes in the Salt Lake area. One of the first hikes I ever went on that really amazed me was the Lake Blanche trail in Big Cottonwood Canyon. I didn't realize that such amazing things could be so close to the city I lived in.

I started to make notes in the book every time I would finish a hike, listing the person(s) I was with, the date, and any additional info. I started to complete more and more hikes near my house, and the book sustained more and more accidental damage over the years. I've now completed around half the hikes in the book, having hiked many of the trails several times. My goal is to finish all of the hikes in the book someday, but it may take a while as many of the hikes are around an hour away and take a full days commitment. 

Hiking is something that has helped me to appreciate being outside, appreciate the outdoors and appreciate being alive. I hope to hike in many more places around the world as I travel and move in the future. The Appalachian trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and other long through hikes also interest me, although I'm not ready to dedicate so much of my life to a trip yet. No matter where I go I'll be on the lookout for places I can throw on a backpack and take a hike to.
