Today I finished creating this blog as I have been intending to do for a long time. I'm currently living in Salt Lake City and recently graduated from the University of Utah. I just started working as a full time software engineer this last week and found myself free from school projects and ready to move onto the next phase of my life.

Posts on this site will center around my hobbies including art, science, food and being outdoors. I will be posting personal thoughts and opinions but I'm (probably) not an expert on anything that will appear on this site. I hope to keep this updated around once a week, but that's probably being optimistic.

If you're interested in looking at some of the technical projects I'm working on head over to [nicmetz.com](http://www.nicmetz.com/). If you want to keep in touch you'll have to stalk me and find my contact info.
